# Disclaimer
I DO NOT encourage piracy and DO NOT support any form of downloader/recorder designed with the help of this repository and in general anything that goes against the Spotify ToS. 
I have built in a standard premium checker, and if any forks are made that override this requirement, I will pull the code.
Please please please, do not do this stuff, as it will endanger the future of this, and many other projects.

# Wavee 
Wavee is a alternative to the original Spotify desktop client for Windows.
It is written in native C#, in combination with WinUI (using Windows App Sdk), for a native Windows 11 Spotify experience. 
Playback is handles using NAudio.
